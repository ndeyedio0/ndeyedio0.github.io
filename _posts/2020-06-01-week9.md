This week I focused my efforts on created a research poster that synthesized all of the work I've done this summer. On my poster, I created seven main sections: Abstract, Methods, Results, Future Works,
Diversity Scoring, and References. I also got some feedback from my mentor about what I should add and remove from my poster to give it more depth and clarity. I'm excited to have finished this poster, which
I can now present at future conferences and events.
