title: Week 10

This week I focused on finishing the draft of my final report. In my draft, I wrote about my findings, methods of research, and a call to action. I had my report reviewed by multiple writer centers on the host university's campus. The report can be found under the "About my Project" section on this site. As I wrap up this project, I think a lot about how I have grown as a developer, student, and researcher, and would like to give a shoutout to my mentor and the DREU program.
