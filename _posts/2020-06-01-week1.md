The first week of my DREU, I was introduced to my project and assigned initial tasks. My first task was a literature review. One of the projects my mentor is currently working on is auditing LLMs for cultural representation issues. They have done some of these investigations on text-based models (like GTP-4, Vicuna, etc.) and now want to expand this to other modalities (images for e.g.). I did a literature review on a paper about stable bias, and how it relates to cultural representation in LLM's. The overarching theme of my project will be to replicate the methods indicated in the papers on LLM's.
