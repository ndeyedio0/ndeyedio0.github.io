This week, I focused on enhancing my coding skills. As someone who is not a strong coder, my mentor and I thought it would be best for me the enhance my skills in Python to prepare for the replication process. I am using platforms like Leetocde and CodeSignal to learn more about Python syntax. I have also opened a GitHub repository where I will be storing and editing my code for this project.
