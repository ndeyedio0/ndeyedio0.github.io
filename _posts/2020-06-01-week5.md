This week, I continued working on the base code for my project. I created the different functions and made called them in my code. I also added comments to my code to better describe what is happening in my code. I finally figured out how to get an API key, and implemented it into my code. 
Now, I am having issues with my code because it says that open.ai image is no longer supported by openai>=1.0.0. I'm planning to meet with my mentor later this week to continue discussing issues with my code and how to move forward from there.
