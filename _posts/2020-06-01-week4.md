title: Week 4

This week, I started on my base code for the project. I worked on defining the professions, ethnicities, and genders using the techniques and things stated in the papers from week 1. 
l. I also installed OPEN AI and made an account. In the code, I imported OPEN AI as my main package. One thing I am sturggling with is generating a key for OPEN AI. I'm not really sure how to get the key,
but once I do, it will be able to have better access to authorization and authentication.
