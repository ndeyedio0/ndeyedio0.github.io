This week, I focused more on learning about LLM's. I did research online and used platforms like DeepLearningAI to learn about LLMs and how AI systems can play a role in that. I also worked on more coding practices and created a timeline for the things I want to accomplish, and when I want to accomplish them during these ten weeks.
