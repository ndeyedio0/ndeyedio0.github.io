## About Me

Hello, my name is Ndeye Diop and I am a junior at the University of Washington studying Informatics with a focus on Data Science in the iSchool, graduating in 2026. I am passionate about studying technology use in minority communities and am also extremely interested in research. I hope to attend graduate school, obtaining my master's degree in human-computer interaction and my Ph.D. in Human-Centered Design and Engineering. I would love to connect, so feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn at www.linkedin.com/in/ndeyeadiop, or at ndeyedio@uw.edu!

## About My Mentor

Tanu Mitra is an Assistant Professor at the University of Washington Information School, where she leads the Social Computing research group. Her research focuses on studying and building large-scale social computing systems to understand and counter problematic information online. Her work employs a range of interdisciplinary methods from the fields of human-computer interaction, data mining, machine learning, and natural language processing.

Dr. Mitra’s work has been supported by grants from the NSF, DoD, Social Science One, and other Foundations. Her research has been recognized through multiple awards and honors, including an NSF-CRII award and the Virginia Tech College of Engineering Outstanding New Assistant Professor Award.

## About My Project

This project focuses on the replication of existing TTI (text-to-image) modeling systems to discover bias within LLM (language learning models). Using Python, and text-based models, this project generates and analyzes a diverse set of image prompts to evaluate variations across ethnicity, gender, and professional attributes, providing insights into the social biases encoded in these AI systems.
